## Overview

**MacSimPE** is a native macOS re-implementation of **SimPE**, the Sims 2 Package Editor originally developed by **Quaxi** and **Peter Jones**.  
It translates the original C# SimPE 0.72.x codebase into **Objective-C**, with the goal of achieving feature parity with the final stable release, **SimPE 0.75f**.

The purpose of MacSimPE is to provide creators and modders using the **Aspyr Sims 2 Super Collection** with a modern, open-source, and fully Mac-native package editing tool ‚Äî free of Windows dependencies and built on clean, GPL-compliant code.

## Project Goals

- ‚úÖ Preserve legitimate SimPE functionality under macOS  
- ‚úÖ Maintain GPLv2+ license continuity from the original open-source project  
- ‚úÖ Ensure cross-compatibility with the Aspyr **Sims 2 Super Collection**  
- ‚úÖ Support modern high-resolution displays and macOS file handling  
- üöß Ongoing work: DBPF parsing, TXTR/TXMT/MMAT editors, and object recolor support  

All development occurs in a **private working repository** (`MacSimPE`) with this read-only mirror provided for transparency, historical record, and community review.
