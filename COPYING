\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\
\
#### Preamble\
\
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\
free software\'97to make sure the software is free for all its users.\
\
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\
your programs, too.\

\
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\
\
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,\
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"\
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\
the term "modification.")  Each licensee is addressed as "you".\
\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\
\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the\
Program.\
\
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\
\

\
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\
---------------------------------------------\
\
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\
\
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to\
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full license is found.\
\
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\
\
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\
    (at your option) any later version.\
\
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\
    GNU General Public License for more details.\
\
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.\
\
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\
\
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\
when it starts in an interactive mode:\
\
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\
\
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\
mouse-clicks or menu items\'97whatever suits your program.\
\
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if\
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\
\
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\
\
  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\

\
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\
Public License instead of this License.}
